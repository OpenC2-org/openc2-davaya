README-based design

JAEN can be expressed in various equivalent syntax languages:
 * PASN
 * YANG-Expression - functional programming subset of YANG (pure data, constant assignments only,
     without control flow or variables)
 * Abstract ANTLR

JAEN is the philosophical equivalent of JSON - simple data model usable across programming languages,
    operating systems, and messaging formats.  Additional features from syntax languages is an anti-goal.
    Minimum essential capability, not lowest common denominator (e.g., PASN MAP).

Rewrite ATTRIBUTE and CHOICE using MAP with options
 1. ATTRIBUTE = CHOICE with enumerated type (allows subset of CHOICE defined in different namespace)
 2. CHOICE with names/tags (unlike unnamed ASN.1 CHOICE with only tag uniqueness) - promotes name to "*" field

Open vocabularies (can't work without enumeration, make vocabulary extension simple).

Namespaced IDs - int or [int,int]
